# SPARKNaCl

SPARK 2014 re-implementation of the TweetNaCl crypto library.

This library is a compact reference implementation of the NaCl crypto library. It was originally inspired by the TweetNaCl implementation, but offers a completely automated static proof of type-safety (and some correctness properties), reasonable performance, and (unlike TweetNaCl) is readable owing to the large number of explanatory comments and contracts in the code.
